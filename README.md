# Matrix-Calculator

Developed a linear algebra/number theory calculator that servers as an automation tool for algebraic calculations to aid university students in solving matrix operations and efficiently solve modulo arithmetic equations 

## Two Key Features:
1. The number theory calculator takes a positive integer input and outputs the prime factorization of n, every primitive root (modulo n), every positive prime number less than n, and all of the units (modulo n).
2. The linear algebra calculator returns a unique solution to a user-specified system of linear equations as well as calculates determinants, inverses, transposes, and multiplies matrices

## Languages/Frameworks used: 
1. Javascript
2. React.js
3. Node.js/Express.js
4. Material-UI
5. HTML/CSS
6. Jest Testing Framework

## Motivation: 
In my Math 145/146 (Advanced Algebra I, Linear Algebra I) classes, we explored different conjectures and techniques to efficiently solve modulo arithmetic equations and systems of linear equations. I initially wanted to build this App to minimize the tedious calculations for my math assignments so that I could focus on finding unique and insightful patterns.

### Express Server Setup 

```sh
cd ./server
npm install
npm start
```

This will run the server on port 5000

### Frontend React Setup
```sh
cd ./client
npm install
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

``` npm run build ```  

This builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### How to run the sample test cases?  

In the project directory, run 

```sh
cd ./server
npm install
npm test
```
